            <h1>Welcome to the YBOX!!!!!</h1> 
            <p> We are a Microsoft Company that would like to bring game systems all around the world
                to places that cannot normally afford them. Why can't refugee children play on a game system.
                They want to have fun too. Plus if anyone becomes really good they could become professional gamers
                and get their families out of the camp. So really we are giving fun and we are giving opportunity!
            </p>
            <p> Plus we are legit. Oprah wants to help the refugees too!</p>
